# AI_FinalProject

In their final project, students will build a classification model to predict whether a loan offered by LendingClub is likely to default. LendingClub is a leader in direct peer-to-peer connection of borrowers and lenders.

Students will use data from LendingClub to predict whether a loan will be paid off or the loan will be deducted and possibly defaulted. The data is provided with a dictionary file describing the meaning of each parameter.
